# PBS Website

This is a website that exposes the content of the PBS files.

It doesn't expose any resource, at the cost of having a lot of server side
processing.

## Configuration

- Put the PBS files in the resource folder
    - You don't have the PBS files? Run `pbSaveAllData` in game
    - You don't have access to the game through RPG Maker XP? Why are you playing
    it?
- `npm install`

## Run the server

- `node index.js`

## TODO

- Search engine
- Learn and use modern frameworks (React?)
